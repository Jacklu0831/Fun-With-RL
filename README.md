# Reinforcement Learning

The most interesting and the most difficult field I have ever touched even just from scratching its surface. However, the fact that it is also one of the hardest challenge humanity is facing is soothing the pain of me needing to open 10 google tabs just to comprehend half a page of research paper. 

# Main Methods

There are too many equations and terms, so I will just list the different approaches to reinforcement learning I have learned so far.

**Monte Carlo Methods** - e-Greedy policies, GLIE, state and action value functions, Bellman Equations\
**Temporal-Different Methods** - Sarsa, Q-Learning, and Expected Sarsa\
**Continuous Spaces** - Discretization, Tile Coding, and Function Appoximations\
**Value-Based Methods** - Implementation of Deep Q-Networks, Double Q-Networks\
**Poluicy-Based Methods** - Stochastic Policy Search, Simulated Annealing, Steepest Hill Climbing Algorithm, Evolution Strategies, Adaptive Noise Scaling, Cross Entropy Method, Policy Gradient Methods, Reinforce Algorithm

# Resources

### Textbook

[Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. Awesome textbook that is not afraid to go indepth into the mathematics. 

### Paper

- [Human-Level Control through Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf)
- [Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461)
- [Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581)
- [Prioritized Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952)

### Structured

The Udacity Nanodegree program help a ton. It helped **a lot** with configuring OpenAI Gym and Unity Environments, provided me with pretty good GPU, and even some skeleton of the code to pull me through the learning curve.
