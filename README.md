# Main Methods 

There are too many equations and terms, so I will just list the different approaches to reinforcement learning I have learned so far.

**Monte Carlo Methods** - e-Greedy policies and GLIE
**Temporal-Different Methods** - Sarsa, Q-Learning, and Expected Sarsa
**Continuous Spaces** - Discretization, Tile Coding, and Coarse Coding  <- this point of the course deep neural network was introduced
**Value-Based Methods** - Deep Q-Networks
