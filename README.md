# Reinforcement Learning

The most interesting and the most difficult field I have ever touched even just from scratching its surface. However, the fact that it is also one of the hardest challenge humanity is facing is soothing the pain of me needing to open 10 google tabs just to comprehend half a page of research paper.  

# Main Topics/Methods

**Monte Carlo Methods** - Epsilon-Greedy policies, GLIE, state and action value functions, Bellman Equations

**Temporal-Different Methods** - Sarsa, Q-Learning, and Expected Sarsa

**Continuous Spaces** - Discretization, Tile Coding, and Function Appoximations

**Value-Based Methods** - Implementation of Deep Q-Networks, Double Q-Networks

**Policy-Based Methods** - Stochastic Policy Search, Hill Climbing Algorithm, REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization, A3C, A2C, N-step bootstrapping, GAE, DDPG, Continuous Control

**Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning** (MARL): Cooperative and Competitive Behaviors, Monte Carlo Tree Search,

### Textbook

[Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. Awesome textbook that is not afraid to go indepth into the mathematics.

### Structured

The Udacity Nanodegree program help a ton. It helped **a lot** with configuring OpenAI Gym and Unity Environments, provided me with pretty good GPU, and even some skeleton of the code to pull me through the learning curve. However, since the course does not seem to be very popular due to the low demand, it is quite unstructured for someone to learn RL from scratch.
